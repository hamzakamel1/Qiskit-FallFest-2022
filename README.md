## Welcome

This is the Qiskit Fall Fest 2022 event page for an American university, in Cairo, Egypt. We're so excited to have you all here. The event is being hosted at the American University in Cairo. 

Qiskit FallFest aims to create awareness about Quantum Computing so we can inspire many people to engage with this new Era and create a better solution for a better world.  

The Qiskit Fall Fest is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM throughout September to design and plan their events, which are then run in October. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all to help to grow the local community’s skill set.

The Fall Fest at AUC this year is going to be an in-person workshops + quantum challenge and Hackathon’s format, starting on October 28th, Friday, 2022, In person. Details about the event and rules can be found below. The deadline for registration is October 27th, at 11:59 pm GMT+2. We are looking forward to seeing you at the event!

## SERIES OF WORKSHOPS


### Introduction to Quantum Computing: 

The use of quantum computing is on the rise. Since its application offers a solution to problems involving overly complex computations in artificial intelligence, chemistry, and cryptography, among other fields, businesses and governments are investing in its study and development. Developers that can program quantum computers are in demand from players like IBM and Microsoft. They provide us with free access to their platforms to achieve this. Finding the tools, materials, and events that can help one improve all their skills is now the problem. The opportunity to have a vision of this vast and complicated world will be discussed in this lecture.



### Road map to join IBM and Qiskit community: 
In this Workshop we will discuss how to join the Quantum Computing Community for IBM and Qiskit. Also, how to be IBM Certified Associate Developer - Quantum Computation using Qiskit v0.2X, and how to join Qiskit Advocate program. In addition, the full guidance to use Qiskit Textbook. 



### Introduction to Quantum Gates and Circuits:
A basic quantum circuit using a few qubits is known as a quantum gate or quantum logic gate. It indicates that superposition and entanglement, two fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics, are utterly beyond the grasp of classical gates. Quantum gates are reversible, to put it simply. Digital circuits are built in traditional computing by connecting sets of logic gates. Like conventional logic gates, quantum logic gates compute the output by operating on input states that are typically in superposition states. The speaker will go into detail about single and multiple qubit gates in this Workshop.


### Solving problems with Quantum Computers & Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm:
In this workshop we will discuss how to solve problems with Quantum Computers also, we will talk about The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm that was the first to show a separation between the quantum and classical difficulty of a problem. This algorithm demonstrates the significance of allowing quantum amplitudes to take both positive and negative values, as opposed to classical probabilities that are always non-negative.


### Run on real hardware:
In this workshop we will run The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm on a real Quantum Computing. The previous workshops are required to understand and complete this workshop. 

### Quantum Machine learning:
In this workshop, the presenter will introduce Quantum Machine learning.   The main goal of Quantum Machine Learning is to speed things up by applying what we know from quantum computing to machine learning. The theory of Quantum Machine Learning takes elements from classical Machine Learning theory and views quantum computing from that lens.

### New approach - Quantum AI Art: 
I believe AI, machine learning, and deep learning, and Quantum Computing will bring this whole business and its applications to a whole new level from different aspects including but not limited to:
1- Machine Assisted creativity (Creative Assistant)
2- Speed of production & automation.
3- Support invention and innovation in different businesses and industries like education, medical, space, industrial design, and more. In this workshop, we will highlight how AI, Machine, and deep learning, Quantum Computing can serve in all three aspects, with some notes from the current ongoing initiatives in those areas.
##### Note: This workshop is required to join the Hackathon

### How to Reduc the depth of the Fully entangled Quantum circuit: 
This workshop will be provided to get some information and Guidance for the Challenge; Also, the speaker will give a simple example that can help the participances to complete the challenge. 
Note: This workshop is required to join the Challenge.
